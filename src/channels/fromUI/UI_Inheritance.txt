The CARMetal geometry UI utilizes a hierarchical structure to describe their objects
These objects are contained primarily in 'src/rene/zirkel/objects'
This hierarchy is as follows:

ConstructionObject
	PointObject
		IntersectionObject
			AxisFunctionIntersectionObject
			CircleIntersectionObject
			LineCircleIntersectionObject
			LineIntersectionObject
			LineQuadraticIntersectionObject
			PointonObjectIntersectionObject
			QuadraticQuadraticIntersectionObject
		MidpointObject
	PrimitiveLineObject
		TwoPointLineObject
			SegmentObject
				VectorObject
			RayObject
			LineObject
		AxisObject
		FixedAngleObject
		ParallelObject
		PlumbObject
